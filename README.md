# Pseudo code compiler
This is a compiler aiming to implement the pseudo code language used by College Board for the AP Computer Science principles course. This is not made by College Board or an employee of College Board and the compiler is unofficial.

# Note
This is work in progress so far and will not compile code yet. I should update this message once I get a working version might take a while.
