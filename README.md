# Pseudo code compiler
This is a compiler aiming to implement the pseudo code language used by College Board for the AP Computer Science principles course. This is not made by College Board or an employee of College Board and the compiler is unofficial.

## things that are different from the implementation
There are some things i decided to make different. These are mostly minor changes. instead of an arrow character being used for asignments a `<-` is used instead. boolean operators that aren't on the keyboard such as not equals or greater than or equal to are a concatenation of characters. != for not equals and \<= and \>= for greater/less than or equal. You can also ommit spaces between math and boolean operators(your welcome it makes my life way harder).

## Note
This is work in progress so far and will not compile code yet. I should update this message once I get a working version might take a while.
